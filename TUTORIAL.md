# Reproduce Knots, then build your own

Bitcoin Knots is not a hand-maintained fork. Each release is rebuilt from three
public inputs:

1. a base Bitcoin Core release tag,
2. a spec file: the list of PR branches to merge, in order,
3. the branches themselves.

A script called `assemble-knots.pl` reads the spec, checks out the base, and
merges each branch in turn. Because it is deterministic, anyone can rebuild a
release and confirm it matches what Luke published, and anyone can write their
own spec to build a custom Knots.

This guide does both. Every command below was run for real.

## Part 1: Reproduce an official release

This confirms your machine and the public sources produce the exact release
commit Luke shipped.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/chrisguida/knots-assembly
cd knots-assembly
./.ci/run-all.sh v29.3.knots20260508
```

The tag is all you need. The script finds the matching spec, fetches every
branch, runs the assembler, and compares the result to the release tag. If it
matches, that release is reproducible from public sources. If it does not, a
branch upstream moved or was deleted.

You only need `git` and `perl`. The assembler is plain Perl with no extra
modules to install.

## Part 2: Build your own sub-Knots

A sub-Knots is a derivative of Knots, built the same way Knots is built from
Core. Instead of checking out Core and rebuilding all of Knots, you check out a
finished Knots release and merge only your own changes on top. The recipe stays
short and the build is fast.

### Simplest case: reproduce garbageman

garbageman is a filtering node that peers with libre-relay nodes. Its whole
recipe is two lines:

```
checkout v29.3.knots20260508
	n/a	chrisguida/garbageman-29.3	last=ccc7097e24 chrisguida/garbageman-29.3
```

Save it as `knots-garbageman.spec` and assemble it (see "Assembling by hand"
below, since it is not a release spec). The result is a clean merge with no
conflicts, and the source is identical to `chrisguida/bitcoin:garbageman-29.3`.
garbageman is just "Knots 29.3 plus one pinned branch."

### Real case: stack several branches

A spec is an ordered list of merges, so add one line per branch. The branch name
tells the assembler which remote to use:

| name in the spec | where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `chrisguida/garbageman-29.3` | `chrisguida/bitcoin`, branch `garbageman-29.3` |
| `origin-pull-k/319/head` | `bitcoinknots/bitcoin` PR 319 |
| `origin-pull/NNNN/head` | `bitcoin/bitcoin` PR NNNN |

Here is garbageman plus four in-flight PRs of my own. These are proposed
refinements to reduced-data policy, not the RDTS softfork itself (that is already
merged into Knots as #238). They may or may not land upstream; they are here only
as an example of stacking your own branches:

```
checkout v29.3.knots20260508
	n/a	chrisguida/garbageman-29.3	last=ccc7097e24 chrisguida/garbageman-29.3
	k319	origin-pull-k/319/head	last=3b776a4c6b origin-pull-k/319/head
	k320	origin-pull-k/320/head	last=d97ca9de47 origin-pull-k/320/head
	k323	origin-pull-k/323/head	last=ff900daadf origin-pull-k/323/head
	k324	origin-pull-k/324/head	last=02331284b1 origin-pull-k/324/head
```

All five merges come out clean, with 14 commits over the release. Both the
garbageman code and the PR changes are present.

Two things to know:

- Any branch with a `/` in its name needs `last=<sha> <branch>` after it. This
  pins the commit you built against so you can tell when the branch moves later.
  Leave it off and the assembler stops with "provide last= for direct remote
  merge."
- A PR's base is usually not the release. These PRs target `29.x-knots`, which is
  a little ahead of the 29.3 release, so each one also brings the few dev commits
  between the release and the branch. Here that is about two commits each and
  merges cleanly. If a branch is far ahead you will get conflicts, which is the
  sign to rebase it onto the release first.

### Assembling by hand

`run-all.sh` compares against a release tag, and a custom spec has none, so run
the assembler directly:

```bash
# 1. a bitcoin repo with the base tag and your branches as remotes
git clone https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin.git bitcoin && cd bitcoin
git remote add chrisguida https://github.com/chrisguida/bitcoin.git
git remote add origin-pull-k https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin.git
git fetch --all
git fetch origin-pull-k '+refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin-pull-k/*/head'
git branch -f master origin/master   # the assembler's poison check needs a local master

# 2. work from the base tag and run the assembler on your spec
git worktree add --detach ../build v29.3.knots20260508
cd ../build
perl ../knots-assembly/assemble-knots/assemble-knots.pl --skip-update-check ../my.spec
```

Run `extract-remotes.pl < my.spec` to print the exact remotes and refs a spec
needs, then script the fetches from that.

## Part 3: Compile

Knots 29.3 adds the reduced-data softfork (RDTS, BIP110), so the build asks you
to state your consent to the deployment logic:

```bash
cmake -B build -D RDTS_CONSENT=IMPLICIT \
      -D BUILD_GUI=OFF -D BUILD_TESTS=OFF -D BUILD_BENCH=OFF
cmake --build build -j"$(nproc)" --target bitcoind bitcoin-cli
```

Drop the `OFF` flags if you want the GUI and tests. For a filtering node, do not
run with `-corepolicy`: it switches to Core policy and turns off the filtering
that a garbageman node is there to do.

## Part 4: Run it and check it is stable

A custom build is only as good as your testing. Do not put an untested binary on
mainnet.

1. Sync it yourself first. A full mainnet initial sync runs your build against
   millions of real transactions and is the best stress test there is. Policy
   bugs tend to show up during sync.
2. Watch for asserts. Filtering and reduced-data code add new checks. Grep the
   log for `Assertion failed` and `Internal bug` and treat any hit as a blocker.
3. Run the functional tests before you deploy:
   `build/test/functional/test_runner.py`. Add tests for whatever your PRs
   change.
4. Leave it running for days, not minutes. Slow leaks, reorg handling, and peer
   churn only show up over time. Keep an eye on memory and peer count.
5. If it is a garbageman node, check the disguise. A filtering node can be spotted
   by what it will not relay, so audit your own node before you rely on it.

For a one-command deploy with a node, Tor, and a watchdog, see
`libre-recon/deploy`.

## Part 5: Run it on Start9 (optional)

**Requires StartOS 0.4.0 or newer.** This uses the flavor-versioned package
format (`#knots:...`, SDK 1.5.3), which does not exist on StartOS 0.3.5.x. If your
Knots package version already shows the `#knots:` prefix you are on the 0.4.0
line; if not, this will not install. Check before you start.

If you run a Start9 (StartOS) box, you can run your sub-Knots on it and reuse the
chain it already synced, no 800GB re-download. Two facts make this work: a
sub-Knots built on Knots 29.3 uses the identical Bitcoin Core data format, and
StartOS keeps a package's data across version updates. So you ship your build as
an update to the existing Knots package.

Start from a fork of the official package,
[`Start9Labs/bitcoin-knots-startos`](https://github.com/Start9Labs/bitcoin-knots-startos),
and change two things.

First, build from source instead of downloading the signed release. In the
`Dockerfile`, replace the "download tarball, verify signatures" build stage with
a from-source build of your recipe: check out the Knots release, merge your
feature branches, then `cmake` with `RDTS_CONSENT=IMPLICIT`. The final image also
needs the runtime libraries your binary links (libevent, libsqlite3), which the
self-contained release tarball did not.

Second, bump the version in `startos/versions/current.ts` (for example
`29.3.1:10` to `29.3.1:11`), keeping the same package id `bitcoind` and `knots`
flavor. That is what makes StartOS treat it as an in-place update and keep your
chain volume.

A complete working example, both changes applied for garbageman plus the four
policy branches from Part 2, is in the
[`garbageman-rdts` fork branch](https://github.com/privkeyio/bitcoin-knots-startos/tree/garbageman-rdts).

Then build the package for your box's architecture and sideload it:

```bash
make x86        # Start9 boxes are usually arm64: use `make arm`
# produces bitcoind_x86_64.s9pk -> sideload it via the StartOS UI
```

StartOS updates the `bitcoind` package, keeps the `main` volume, and your node
comes back up on the same chain, now running your sub-Knots.

Two cautions:

- You are trusting your own build, not the release signatures. The spec is what
  makes that auditable: anyone can reproduce the same binary and check it.
- Never install a version older than the one that wrote the datadir. A
  same-version sub-Knots (29.3) is safe.

## Sharing

Once your Knots is a spec file, you can share the recipe instead of a binary.
Anyone can rebuild your exact node, and "what is in this build" is answered by
reading a few lines.
